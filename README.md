My To-Do List - MISSO Techonology Deliverable

I built this To-Do List application to submit as I am running to be MISSO's Spring 2022 Technology officer.
This application is a simple to-do list that allows you to add events with a simple input text line,
mark them as completed as well as delete them when no longer needed.
The application also allows the user to filter the events for uncompleted events, completed events, and all.

To help with my project, I followed Dev Ed's project to fulfill this project using REACT.
Likewise, I asked for help from peers to ensure that the application would run with minimal errors.

Unfortunately, I was unable to deploy the application to a Netlify app due to a compile error
but I was able to start and run the application through the development server for React.

INSTALLATION:
To install the application you must ensure that you have Node.js installed on your device.

Node Installation: https://nodejs.org/en/

You must also obtain the files of the application found on this github.
Download the files as a .zip to an easily accessible folder.

Once Node.js and the app files have been installed.

Run your cmd.exe, git bash, or your IDE terminal (terminal of choice) and 'cd' to traverse to a desired folder

Run the command 'npx create-react-app missotodo' to create the React development.

Extract all the missotodo.zip files into your newly created missotodo folder created from the command, you should replace all the different
files from the newly created missotodo folder with the files in the .zip.

Navigate to the missotodo folder with 'cd' in your chosen terminal.
Following this you should be able to run the application through your terminal with the command:
'npm start'

This should allow the application to run in a development server on your browser!

Done! Your application should run and you should be able to create a simple to-do list!
